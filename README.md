# People Work Language (PWL) Extension

The **People Work Language (PWL)** extension provides syntax highlighting and language support for `.ppl` and `.wrk` files. This extension is designed to enhance the development experience for users working with the People Work Language.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**:
  - Keywords like `person`, `user`, `job`, `matrix`, `contact`, `event`, and more.
  - Sentiment constants: `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`.
  - Strings, comments, booleans, dates, and identifiers.
- **Language Configuration**:
  - Auto-closing pairs for brackets, quotes, and parentheses.
  - Comment support for single-line (`//`) and block comments (`/* */`).

## Requirements

No additional dependencies are required to use this extension. Simply install it in Visual Studio Code and start working with `.ppl` and `.wrk` files.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for "People Work Language" and click **Install**.
4. Open a `.ppl` or `.wrk` file to see the syntax highlighting in action.

## File Types Supported

- `.ppl`: People-related definitions (e.g., `person`, `user`, `job`, etc.).
- `.wrk`: Work-related definitions (e.g., `event`, `observations`, `sentiment`, etc.).

## File Icons

The PWL extension provides custom icons for `.ppl` and `.wrk` files. These icons are compatible with VS Code's built-in icon themes. For the best experience:

1. Ensure a base File Icon Theme is enabled in VS Code (we recommend "Seti")
   - Open Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P)
   - Type "File Icon Theme"
   - Select "Seti" or another base theme
2. Your PWL files will automatically use the PWL-specific icons while other files use the base theme's icons
